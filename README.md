# Apache Atlas REST API - working examples

I'm preparing the implementation of Apache Atlas on a data lake (Hadoop Data Platform 2.6.3) and to speed things up, I want to have Atlas REST API calls ready to run. I've tried the Atlas REST API Swagger (http://atlas.apache.org/api/v2/ui/index.html#/), but I couldn't get every API call from it working. Therefor I've tried and tried and this is a set of API calls that I managed to run on a Hortonworks Data Platform 2.6.3 Sandbox.
